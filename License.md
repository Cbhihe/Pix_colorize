#### Terms and copyright:
Feel free to copy any material found here and to further release it to the general public, subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License v3... That license is not a right granted to you to plagiarize the content of the repo. Your publisher, your editor, your university, your mother and common decency all have rules against that.  So use common sense and live happily ever after.

TLDR: *Basically the material on this repo is available for free (as in "free beer") as long as you always attach its authors' names to it, along with the above mentioned license's terms. You should also not include it in other work, program, product or applications (commercial in nature or not) which do not comply with the GNU General Public License v3 or with something "very very close".*
Of course the above one sentence summary cannot be considered authoritative in terms of licensing.  It does not replace the GNU General Public License v3 included in this [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which recoups the complete licensing terms for your reading pleasure. ;-)

The repo material copyright however stays with me and with any contributors to this repo, according to who contributed what to it. By default  and unless otherwise specified, consider that the Copyright is with this Github repo's owner.
